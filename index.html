<h3> 
An array is kind of like a stoage file, it is used to store multiple varibles at a time. When you are counting with it the first variable starts from 0 then goes to 1, 2, 3, 4, so on so forth.

<br>
<h1> Variables</h1>
<h3>
Variables are like a container, just like an empty box. They are used to store SINGLE values, this can include time, score, etc. While you can change the 
value inside the vsriable you cannot add more values to it, you would have to make another variable for that.
</h3>

<h1>Difference between Variables and Arrays</h1>
<h3> 
There is a major difference between variables and arrays, this is that, variable can only hold one value while arrays can store mutiple at a time. This can decrease the amount of confusion we have
while working, they dont get lost or anything. There are many minor differences between them as well, such as their tags to be called in html.
